          <p>I write some things sometimes. There aren't a lot of things that I 
            find out myself, but I want to put those few things out there. I 
            encourage you to check it out, maybe bookmark some of the posts if 
            they are something you work with.</p>

          <p>Programming isn't just a job, it's a mindset. I am passionate 
            about finding different ways to look at a system or process. The 
            trendy technology and tools are important, and exciting, but you 
            don't always use your brand new stud finder to fix the kitchen sink. 
            Anyone can make a new Facebook or blog site, but what gets me coming 
            back to a project is if it actually helps real people.</p>

      <h2>MPDX - Mobile</h2>
      <h3 class="sub-title">Ministy Partner Development Connexion</h3>
      <img src="pics/port/mpdx_large.jpg" />
      <p>In June 2012, I traveled to Orlando, FL and worked with a team on to
        build a mobile access portal for MPDX.org. MPDX is being designed as the
        new web application solution for missionaries who raise their own 
        financial support. My role was leading the mobile apps team where I 
        worked with another member to train him in javascript development and 
        project management. We built the apps using Phonegap and are currently 
        targeting Android and iOS devices with offline applications and is also
        accessible via the web. We chose PhoneGap because we wanted a fast 
        start-up time and the oppertunity to target any smart phone.</p>
      <p>To start off the first week of the project, we worked to explore dynamic 
        view (HTML page) creation techniques and other tools we would need to 
        develop for a PhoneGap application. After becoming aquated with our new tool set, we made <a href="http://lumzy.com/access/?id=8A41BC96258426AE2EE006865AAE99A5" target="_blank">wireframes</a> 
        to lay out some of the basic features we wanted on the different views. 
        After about a week of development, to help streamline development and 
        expansion, we looked into Javascript MVC 
        (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">more info</a>) 
        frameworks and decided on using Backbone.js. After getting the hang of 
        Backbone.js, we were cooking with gas and had a published app on the Play
        Store after about 2.5 months, with the last month me working solo.</p>
      <p>During the first 2 months, we used a white board in the department to 
        make an extensive to-do list with each section of the app. As we 
        transitioned out of pair-programming, the remaining tasks were transfered 
        to the <a href="https://github.com/CruGlobal/mpdx-mobile/issues" target="_blank">Github issues page</a> 
        as the project approached it's beta releases. Now you can track the 
        current code base on the 
        <a href="https://github.com/CruGlobal/mpdx-mobile" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.</p>
      <p>The app is currently available on the 
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mpdx" target="_blank">Android Play Store</a> 
        and the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mpdx/id571838934" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>!</p>

      <p>As many medical conditions can inhibit cognitive abilities, the Mobile 
        Environment Detection project was designed to help people who struggle in
        new environments turn that space into a learning atmosphere. In different 
        locations, facilitators could "capture" items or locations in the space 
        and provide descriptions on whenever was relevant. My role on the project 
        was to do the interface design and begin the groundwork for implementing 
        an Augmented Reality engine.</p>

      <h2>Smart Data Entry App for Autism Therapy</h2>
      <img src="pics/port/dataEntryApp.jpg">
      <p>Extensive records are common in home therapy for a child with autism. 
        Line therapists are given a list of assigned program items (things for 
        the child to work on learning) and begins the process of continually 
        practicing that item until success regularity increases. This process 
        while providing good structure, was slow to adapt and did not allow for 
        use of the testing data after 2 weeks. Out of these problems rose the 
        Smart Data Entry App for Autism Therapy, where instead of having to write 
        each time you complete a trail with the child, you can enter that into a 
        tablet, where that data can be accessed in real time by a senior 
        therapist and can be utilized later in therapy to show things like 
        changes in acquisition speed.</p>

      <p>This app was built as a suite of tools (Mobile Enhanced Autism Therapy) 
        built to further different areas in the autism therapy field.</p>
